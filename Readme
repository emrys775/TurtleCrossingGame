# Turtle Crossing Game

This is a Python-based Turtle Crossing Game, where the player controls a turtle and helps it cross the road while avoiding cars. The game becomes progressively harder as the level increases.

## Game Features
- A turtle that can move up and down using arrow keys.
- Randomly moving cars of different colors from left to right.
- Levels that increase speed as the player safely crosses the road.
- A scoreboard displayed at the top-right corner of the screen.
- "Game Over" if the turtle collides with a car.

## File Structure
The project is split across multiple Python files for easier maintenance:
1. **`main.py`**: The entry point of the game. Manages the screen, handles the game loop, and connects all components together.
2. **`player.py`**: Handles the turtle player logic, including movement and resetting position.
3. **`car_manager.py`**: Manages the cars, including their creation, movement, and speed adjustments.
4. **`scoreboard.py`**: Displays and updates the game score, levels, and "Game Over" message.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- `turtle` module (comes pre-installed with Python)

## How to Play
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open the project in your preferred Python IDE (e.g., PyCharm or VS Code).
3. Ensure all the files (`main.py`, `player.py`, `car_manager.py`, and `scoreboard.py`) are in the same directory.
4. Run the `main.py` file to start the game.
5. Use the **Up arrow key** to move the turtle forward and the **Down arrow key** to move backward.
6. Avoid the cars and cross the road to increase your level.
7. If the turtle collides with a car, the game ends.

## Levels and Scoring
- Each time the turtle successfully crosses the road, the level increases.
- Cars move faster with each level, increasing the difficulty.
